# NOTE on colorspace in common
# https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#colorspace
# A majority of the image formats assume an sRGB colorspace (e.g. JPEG, PNG, etc.).
# A few support only linear RGB (e.g. EXR, DPX, CIN, HDR) or only linear GRAY (e.g. PGM). A few formats support CMYK.
# Then there is the occasional format that also supports LAB (that is CieLAB) (e.g. TIFF, PSD, JPG, JP2).
#
# NOTE on openslide`s bit-depth and colorspace of output image
# from openslide sources:
#
# ImageSlide.read_region: tile = Image.new("RGBA", size, (0,) * 4) -- RGBA (4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask)
#
# OpenSlide.read_region:
#   buf = (w * h * c_uint32)() -- c_uint32 for RGBA means uint_8 for each channel. So format is the same as above
#   ...
#   return PIL.Image.frombuffer('RGBA', size, buf, 'raw', 'RGBA', 0, 1)
#
# So if we use read_region, then we always have output image of this mode: RGBA (4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask)
